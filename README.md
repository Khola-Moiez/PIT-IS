# Project Title: Python Task Collection

## Description
This project is a collection of various Python tasks that demonstrate different functionalities, including encryption, password strength checking, and keylogging. Each task is implemented in a separate Python file.

## Task Summaries

### Task 01: Caesar Cipher
- Implements a Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages.
- Provides a command-line interface for users to choose between encryption and decryption.

### Task 02: Image Encryption
- Encrypts and decrypts images using an XOR operation with a specified key.
- Provides a command-line interface for users to select options.

### Task 03: Password Strength Checker
- Checks the strength of a password based on various criteria (length, character types).
- Provides feedback for improvement.

### Task 04: Keylogger
- Logs keystrokes to a file with timestamps.
- Includes an ethical disclaimer and runs until the 'Esc' key is pressed.

### Task 05: Basic Packet Sniffer
- Implements a packet sniffer using the Scapy library.
- Captures network packets and processes them to extract information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol type (TCP/UDP), and payload data.
- Provides a command-line interface for users to specify the network interface and the number of packets to capture.

## Ethical Disclaimer
The keylogger (Task 04) and packet sniffer (Task 05) are for educational purposes only. Do not use them without explicit permission from the user or network owner. By running these programs, you agree to use them responsibly.
